This tool is no-longer in use and you will likely encounter many issues attempting to use it. We are working on a sustainable long-term solution for content creation. For now, we recommend you use [GitBook](https://gitbook.com), with the [Sushi Card template](https://github.com/PhilipHarney/gitbook-template-sushi). You can do this by creating a new GitBook, choosing Git as the basis for that book and entering the Clone URL of the template repo in the creation form.
